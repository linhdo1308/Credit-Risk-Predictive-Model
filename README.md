# Home-Credit-Risk-Kaggle

## a. Business Problem

Home Credit focuses on delivering greater access to financial services through financial inclusion efforts across markets, including the unbanked. With insufficient or non-existent credit history, it is hard for them to receive loans from financial institutions. However, in order to guarantee a positive and safe borrowing experience, Home Credit needs to predict their ability of loan repayments with data.

The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model on clients’ ability of loan repayments.

## b. Analytical Methodology

Default risk prediction will be generated using a supervised machine learning classification model. Historical loan application data will be split into two sets, 80% for training and 20% for test. My team will build the model based on the trained dataset and test its performance on the test set. The model will analyze factors like applicant demographics, credit history, past loan performance and repayment behavior to predict the chances of clients’ default on loans. Throughout the project, we try different feature engineering and predictive models. In general, our best model (CATBOOST) achieves an overall 70% accuracy and a balanced predictability between defaulters & non-defaults.
